## BlackJack card game Proposal

#What is blackjack?
A gambling card game in which players go against the house(dealer).  The objective is to get a pair of cards to have a value closest or equal to 21.  The player or dealer with the higher value will win the round and if there is a tie, it is considered a push and no wagers will be lost.  Players will start with a bank in order to place bets.

#Initial thoughts on game structure
I am going to create an array of 52 cards with designated colors and suits(I may multiply the deck depending on complexity). 
There will be a few challenges such as splits if the player receives the two of the same value cards or doubling down.
I will also use animation to bring the cards to the table from the deck.

#Phases of Completion
Friday 2/2 = pseudocode, whiteboarding, initial framing of the board
Sat,Sun = write the backend code
Monday = animations and design
Tuesday = Refactoring the code
